I continue to make good progress today on setting up the personal agile environment.

The following pages are now on the blog:

- Home
- Archive - Generated from items in /posts
- Sprints - Generated from items in /sprints
- Backlog - Generated from items in /backlog
- About Me

Sprints contain items from the backlog. Backlog items contain task and blog posts created while completing the item.

For example the [backlog item](/stories/setup-personal-agile-environment) I am currently working on has links to 3 blog posts.

There are probably some improvements that can be made, such as automating the addition of blog posts to backlog items, perhaps using tags.
