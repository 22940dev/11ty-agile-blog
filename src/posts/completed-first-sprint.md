I completed the [first sprint yesterday](/sprints/Week_34-2020_08_17-2020_08_23/). All stories were completed.

It a day behind schedule because there couldn't be any planning so it wasn't clear what tasks needed to be done, since before the sprint no system even existed to manage stories.

Today I will create a new sprint and add some stories and do a retrospective of the previous sprint.
