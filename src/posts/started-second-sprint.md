Following a [week34 retrospective](/stories/retrospective-week34), I started a new [sprint for week35](/sprints/Week_35-2020_08_24-2020_08_30) yesterday.

Normally the retrospective would have happened a bit earlier but the previous sprint ran a bit late.

I have added new stories and was able to easily assign them to the new sprint using the 'backlog' tag in the story frontmatter.

As I am writting this post I am wondering whether a feature to more easily add links to stories/sprints would be useful. Sort of similar to how on github you can enter the number of an issue and it gets replaced with the correct link. [Added story to backlog](/stories/quick-links-to-sprints-and-stories).

The plan for today is to tackle the story to [create a project on github](/stories/create-github-project).
