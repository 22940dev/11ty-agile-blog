## Description

Create a project from the current repo that can be shared on github.

## Notes

There is probably a way to set the project up (via a fork) so it's easier to get any changes from the upstream base project, but that's going to be tricky to setup since I have already been adding all commits to master branch. 

In the interest of time, the best way is just to create a totally seperate project and link to the base project in the readme.

## Tasks

- Remove any personal info from repo
- Add README.md
- Create github repo
- Add github repo as a remote
- Push to github remote
